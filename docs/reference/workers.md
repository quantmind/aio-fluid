# Workers

Workers are the main building block for asynchronous programming with `aio-fluid`. They are responsible for running tasks and managing their lifecycle.
There are several worker classes which can be imported from `fluid.utils.worker`:

```python
from fluid.utils.worker import StoppingWorker
```

::: fluid.utils.worker.WorkerState

::: fluid.utils.worker.Worker

::: fluid.utils.worker.WorkerFunction

::: fluid.utils.worker.QueueConsumer

::: fluid.utils.worker.QueueConsumerWorker

::: fluid.utils.worker.AsyncConsumer

::: fluid.utils.worker.Workers
